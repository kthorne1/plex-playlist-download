# plex-playlist-download
Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 Solution for using Plex Webtool generated *.m3u8 playlist files to download music from your plex library
to a local folder or USB (to play off line aka in your car's usb)

Note this is a curde UI and not intended to be a mass market tool. It's for personal use with the awsome Plex media server's music library.
